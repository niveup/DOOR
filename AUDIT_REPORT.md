## Critical
- [ ] **Frontend call has no directly matched Express route** — `frontend/app/interview/page.tsx:88` — ``${backendUrl}/api/interview/evaluate`` could not be matched to an `app.get/post/...` route during static tracing. Dynamic route construction may be involved, so verify manually before fixing. — **Fix pass:** Align the client URL and backend route or remove the dead UI path.
- [ ] **Interview evaluation backend route is absent** — `backend/src/server.ts:1679` — No current `POST /api/interview/evaluate` route exists in the audited server tree. — **Fix pass:** Add a validated AI-backed route and persist/log attempts.
- [ ] **Dashboard displays fixture tasks when no real plan exists** — `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx:64` — The empty dashboard shows realistic sample tasks, which can be mistaken for a generated/persisted plan. — **Fix pass:** Use an explicit EmptyState or label the data unmistakably as a preview.
- [ ] **Journal stores only part of the five-part AI response** — `backend/src/server.ts:537` — The parser stores part 1 as `aiFeedback`, part 3 as pattern, and part 4 as task; parts 2 and 5 are not persisted in the feedback field even though the PRD defines one five-part response. — **Fix pass:** Persist the complete mentor response and parse structured fields separately with validation/retry.
- [ ] **Comeback push-alert data exists but notification delivery is absent** — `prisma/schema.prisma:26` — The PRD requires day-3/day-5/day-7 alerts; the subscription field is defined but no backend read/write or push sender is present. — **Fix pass:** Add subscription management and idempotent scheduled notification delivery.

## Consistency gaps
- [ ] **AI endpoint `/api/ai/test` does not use the complete shared reliability pattern** — `backend/src/server.ts:384` — Missing: strict retry attempt, aiCallLog logging. — **Fix pass:** Standardize extraction, schema validation, one strict retry, and logging in a shared helper.
- [ ] **AI endpoint `/api/journal` does not use the complete shared reliability pattern** — `backend/src/server.ts:443` — Missing: shared robust JSON extraction, strict retry attempt. — **Fix pass:** Standardize extraction, schema validation, one strict retry, and logging in a shared helper.
- [ ] **AI endpoint `/api/routine/plan-chat` does not use the complete shared reliability pattern** — `backend/src/server.ts:689` — Missing: shared robust JSON extraction, strict retry attempt, aiCallLog logging. — **Fix pass:** Standardize extraction, schema validation, one strict retry, and logging in a shared helper.
- [ ] **AI endpoint `/api/tasks/:taskId/status` does not use the complete shared reliability pattern** — `backend/src/server.ts:865` — Missing: shared robust JSON extraction, strict retry attempt. — **Fix pass:** Standardize extraction, schema validation, one strict retry, and logging in a shared helper.

## Security / configuration
- [ ] **Environment variable `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is undocumented** — `backend/src/gateway.ts:15` — It is read in code but absent from both example env files. — **Fix pass:** Document scope, required format, and safe deployment value.

- [ ] **Backend authentication fails open to the published default `1234`** — `backend/src/server.ts:236` — A missing Render env value activates a known credential. — **Fix pass:** Require a strong env secret at startup and use constant-time comparison.
- [ ] **Cron secret is accepted in the query string** — `backend/src/server.ts:230` — URLs leak through logs, histories, and monitoring more readily than headers. — **Fix pass:** Accept the cron secret only via a dedicated header and redact failures.

## Data model
- [ ] **`Task` is not read by traced application code** — `prisma/schema.prisma:72` — The table is one-way in the current implementation. — **Fix pass:** Wire the missing lifecycle operation or remove/defer the model.

- [ ] **Expected business-key constraint missing for `Journal`** — `prisma/schema.prisma:42` — PRD one-per-day/week semantics are not enforced by the expected key `date @unique`. — **Fix pass:** Add and migrate the matching unique constraint.
- [ ] **Expected business-key constraint missing for `RoutinePlan`** — `prisma/schema.prisma:60` — PRD one-per-day/week semantics are not enforced by the expected key `date @unique`. — **Fix pass:** Add and migrate the matching unique constraint.

## AI prompts
- [ ] **Prompt does not state the Hinglish-first register** — `backend/prompts/plan_chat.md:1` — It relies on the shared preamble only, making output behavior fragile if used independently. — **Fix pass:** Keep shared preamble authoritative or restate the required register where parsing depends on it.
- [ ] **Journal prompt and parser agree only on fragile delimiters** — `backend/prompts/journal.md:16` — The prompt requests five natural-language sections while code splits raw text without validating section count or labels. — **Fix pass:** Return schema-constrained JSON or validate five sections and retry strictly.

## Cron / scheduled logic

## Mobile / accessibility / dead code
- [ ] **Shared stylesheet has no requested mobile breakpoint** — `frontend/app/globals.css:3` — No `@media (max-width: 900px)` treatment exists. — **Fix pass:** Add page-shell and dense-content adaptations, then test 360/390px.
- [ ] **Dense horizontally scrolling content needs 360px verification** — `frontend/app/explainer/page.tsx:968` — The page uses minimum widths inside horizontal overflow; controls or essential data may be hidden on a phone. — **Fix pass:** Provide a stacked/mobile representation or prove scrolling is deliberate and announced.
